Summary
Messaging is the concept of sending and receiving data as events across processes, which can include sending messages to any number of parties (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).
Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully managed, highly available messaging system that handles message routing across lots of senders and receivers.
Producers can send messages to topics, which consumers can then subscribe to by creating subscriptions.
Messages can either be pulled by the receiver (“Any messages for me?”) or pushed by the sender (“There’s a message for you!”).
Producers most commonly use Cloud Pub/Sub for fan-out (broadcast) or work-queue (orchestration) messaging.
Cloud Pub/Sub charges based on the amount of data you send through the system, meaning larger messages cost more than smaller messages, with a minimum of 1 KB per message.
